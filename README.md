# Terrian-Classification  
A software to run the basic algorithms in classification  of ground objects in satellite images.  
 Including:   
 
       1.Linear Regressor
       
       2.Simple Neural Networks

   We select 5 kinds of the ground objects, and we combine 6 bands from the satellite images to  
   form a 6-dimension vector as an input for classification.
